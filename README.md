# COVID-19 : A Journey of Analytics 
### By Niko Darby 


## Introduction

<p> COVID-19 is a highly contagious pneumonia-like coronavirus that first appeared in November of 2019 within the residential sectors of Wuhan, China. The virus spread throughout China and subsequently throughout the world. With over three-million reported cases globally and over two-hundred thousand deaths, COVID-19 is deemed to be one of the most drastic plagues of the past century. During these tumultuous times it is essential to examine the data that is provided by medical centers to further confirm the intensity of the COVID-19. 

This project will focus on analyzing COVID-19 deaths via machine learning algorithms in Python, specifically SciKitLearn, to analyze both the logistic and linear regression of global death rate data attained from Kaggle. The data analyzed using Python only extends from early January 2020 to late February 2020. 

In addition, there is a statistical analysis of COVID-19 data in the United States of America. This analysis is performed using the R language to observe the mean, median, pearson correlation, and p-value, of the death, recovered, or confirmed data respectively. Visualizations are also constructed with R to look at the distribution and significance of the death, recovered, and confirmed COVID-19 data. The data examined using R extends from cases reported in February 2020 to May 2020.

This statistical experiment is conducted with the hopes of discovering valuable information that can aid in the strife against the COVID-19 pandemic. Please enjoy the inspection and feel free to contact me if there are any questions: ndarby2050@Gmail.com </p>
